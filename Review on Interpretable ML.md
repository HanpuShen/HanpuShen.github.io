# Review on the Interpretability of ML



## Why do we care about the interpretability of machine learning ?

	1. *Understanding the ML model to make people trust the result, unlike trustworthy ML which don't require understanding.* 
	1. *"Communicate" with the model, identify the limitation of the ML model and improve them afterwards.*
	1. *Toward transfer learning.*

## Frame of Interpretability

â€‹	There are two major direction toward interpretable ML, one focous on the sementical interpretation of the model ( usually focous on the e.g. model structure, features), the other wish to mathematically describe the model
