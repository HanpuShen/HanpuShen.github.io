I am a third-year PhD student in Statistics at UC Irvine. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Roy Fox](https://royf.org).

 with a strong interest in reinforcement learning, empirical bayes, and statistical learning theory in general. My work, recently, focuses on developing efficient algorithms for offline-to-online RL finetuning. I am passionate about advancing research at the intersection of statistics and computer science to solve complex real-world problems. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharing my knowledge through writing and mentoring.
