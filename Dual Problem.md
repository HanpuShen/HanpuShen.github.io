# Dual Problem 

[TOC]

## Primal problem

Recall the optimization problem in standard form:
$$
&p^* := \min_x f_o(x) \\
\textrm{subject to:}& \\
&f_i(x)\leq 0,\ i=[m]
$$
we shell refer to this minimization problem as the *primal problem*. The corresponding value is *primal value*, $F(x) = (f_1(x),f_2(x),\cdots,f_m(x))$ is the *constraint map*, and $x$ that satisfies this constraint is called *feasible solution*.
